# README

The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate how to use Cypress to conduct simple
tests in a Ruby on Rails environment. Our test app in this case is a basic
Twitter clone with CRUD and user session functionality.

Most app functionality is in place; I'm currently focused on implementing the
testing suite. (Yes I realize that I'm kind of working on the whole process
in reverse, that's ok, I needed the refresher anyways.)
